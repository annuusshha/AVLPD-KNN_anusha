->In the traffic control and security management framework, License plate recognition
methodology plays a vital role, which manages more responsibility for high security. Identifying
the moving vehicleâ€™s number plate is a complex task, because of the existence of noise and
differing illumination and angles.
->For accurate and reliable detection of license plate numbers, Automated Vehicle License Plate Detection using KNN (AVLPD-KNN) method is introduced, which identifies the license plate accurately.
->This is an improvised model compared to the current model. Using median filtering approach, character segmentation approach, OCR techniques, and further it is learned and recognized accurately by making use of the machine learning technique, which is termed as KNN classifier.
->The entire computation of the research method is done in MATLAB simulation environment, which confirms that the proposed research technique gives an accurate and qualified detection, when compared with the current research techniques.
